## Summary
- Urban has to many drivers for the total rides that are provided
- Rural has more rides than drivers but less total rides than Suburban and Urban because of the overall fare cost
- If Rural could shift their totla fare cost closer to Subutban and give incentives to the driver to be increase i believe that  they're going to be more total traffic and sales
